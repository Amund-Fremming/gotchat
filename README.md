# Go terminal chat

## Thoughts for next time

- More lightweight client
- End to end encryption for messages
- Make a terminal renderer, and a event handler for rendering incomming messsages with the clients outgoing messages for a more seamless and race condition safe solution.
  - I ran in to some issues here by thinking i could solve it by some cursor magic in my terminal, but this was a waste of time
- Better separation of consern and more testable code

## Learned/Liked from first Go-project

1. Simplistic and fun language
2. Nice way of handling errors and returning information to the caller function
3. Very fan of how go routines work with channels
4. Development could take longer times because of little built in funcitonality, but this also makes learning more fun and deep.
