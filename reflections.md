# Reflections


## Thoughts for next time

- More lightweight client
- End to end encryption for messages
- Better separation of consern and more testable code

## Learned/Liked from first Go-project

1. Simplistic and fun language
2. Nice way of handling errors and returning information to the caller function
3. Very fan of how go routines work with channels
4. Development could take longer times because of little built in funcitonality, but this also makes learning more fun and deep.
